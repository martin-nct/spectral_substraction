# Spectral substraction filter
Implementation of Boll's spectral substraction algorithm. Noise spectrum is obtained from a selected period of time where there is no information. Noise should be stationary. Half wave rectifier is used to reduce residual noise. The algorithm is usefull for discursive signals where noise is stationary, random wide-band noise produces high residual noise at the output.
